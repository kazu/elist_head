// Nodes p, a and y lie in this order between head and tail, and n is alone.
// Inserting n before a reads p as the node before a and stops at
// "add.cas1". a is then marked for deletion and stops at "del.marked", and
// both go on together: the insert makes its first CAS, fails its second on
// the mark of a.prev and takes n out, while the delete waits for it. Before
// the fix, MarkForDelete gave up after 100 tries with a marked but still
// p.next. MarkForDelete must not return while a is linked, and the list must
// hold p and y, walking forward and backward.
